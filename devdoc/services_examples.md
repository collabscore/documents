### Retrieving annotations

Stats on annotations can be obtained at

http://localhost:8000/rest/collections/all/collabscore/saintsaens-ref/C452_0/_annotations/_stats/

Adding the code of an annotation model gives the statistics per annotation concept. Exemple for the model 'image-region': 

http://localhost:8000/rest/collections/all/collabscore/saintsaens-ref/C452_0/_annotations/image-region/_stats/

Adding the ``_all`` keyword retrieves the list of annotation for the model. 

http://localhost:8000/rest/collections/all/collabscore/saintsaens-ref/C452_0/_annotations/image-region/_all/

In the results, annotations are grouped by the id ot the target element (for instance the measure, or the note).  

The list of annotations can be restricted to a single concept. Example for measure-regions:

http://localhost:8000/rest/collections/all/collabscore/saintsaens-ref/C452_0/_annotations/image-region/_all/
