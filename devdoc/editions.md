# Managing editions in CollabScore

Music scores in CollabScore are obtained via Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
applied to IIIF *sources* (see https://github.com/collabscore/documents/blob/main/devdoc/sources.md). 
The OMR proceeds in two phases

 - a JSON file reporting the music symbols found in the score image is produced by the OMR software DMOS
 - a transcription of the JSON content in a standard music score format

The result of the two-phases process  is an XML file (MusicXML or MEI). Since
OMR is inherently error-prone, this file needs to be completed and/or corrected.

  - *completion* may be adding metadata, or adjusting the regions recognized by ORM
  - *correction* is any action that fixes a faulty OMR output

Both completion and corrections are referred to as *editions* in CollabScore.
generally speaking, and edition is an operation applied during the transcription
of the JSON file to the XML file. This operation has a *name* and a list
of *parameters*.

##  Example of an edition

A music score consists of *parts*, i.e., a set of instructions given to 
a performer playing an instrument. In a score one may find a piano part, a
violin part, etc.

In general OMR cannot extract the description of a part, and it has therefore
to be supplied via and external source (a user generally). The description
of a part consists of

 - its instrument (taken from a taxonomy, in order to identify transposing instruments)
 - its name (free text), to be displayed generally at the beginning of the first part's system(s) in the score 
 - its abbreviation, to be used in subsequent systems.

Specifying the description of a part is done with an operation named ``describe_part`` 
that takes as parameter the target part and the above attributes. Its JSON description is as follows:

```json
{
	"name": "describe_part",
	"params": {
		"id": "Part2",
		"values": {
                        "intrument": "Chant",
			"name": "Ténor",
			"abbreviation": "T."
		}
	}
}
```

So the operation has two parameters: ``part``, the id of the part, and
``values``, which is itself an object with three attributes. 

The names and types of the parameters changes from one operation to the other,
but an operation has *always* a ``name``, from which the expected parameter 
values can be decoded.

## Range of editions

An edition can have a *range* of measures. As measure is referred to
by a triplet *(page_number, system_number, measure_number)*. In JSON,
a range has therefore the following form:

```json
{
	"from_page: 2,
	"from_system: 2,
	"from_measure: 1,
	"to_page: 3,
	"to_system: 99,
	"to_measure: 99
}
```
The above range goes from measure 1 of system 2 of page 2 to the
last measure of the last system of page 3. Range can be specified
for some editions.

If a parameter is unspecified, the default value is 1 for ``from`` 
values, and 99 for ``to`` values. The following range applies
to all measures from measure 1 of the third system of page 2.


```json
{
	"from_page: 2,
	"from_system: 3
}
```

## Services on editions

The CollabScore server exchanges operations via REST services. 
The serialization is based on JSON. An operation is always send/received
to/from the ``iiif`` source of a Opus. In general, such a source
is referred to by combining the Opus ref, the keyword ``_sources``
and the source code (``iiif`` in our case). Here is an example:

```
all:collabscore:saintsaens-ref:C006_0/_sources/iiif/
```

The Opus ref can be replaced by its database id, e.g., 

```
22468/_sources/iiif/
```

See the document on sources for explanations. We use this URL for illustrating the services below. Editions can only be accessed by authorized users. The credentials must be given with each call.

### Retrieving editions

The list of editions for a source can be obtained with a GET

```
curl -u login:password -X GET
http://neuma.huma-num.fr/rest/collections/22468/_sources/iiif/_editions
```

The services returns an array of editions:

```json
[
  {
	"name": "describe_part",
	"params": {
		"id": "Part2",
		"values": {
                        "intrument": "Chant",
			"name": "Ténor",
			"abbreviation": "T."
		}
	}
},
  {
	"name": "describe_part",
	"params": {
		"id": "Part1",
		"values": {
                        "intrument": "Piano",
			"name": "Piano",
			"abbreviation": "P."
		}
	}
   }
]
```

### Retrieving a specific edition

A specific edition can be obtained by giving its index in the array
of editions (starting at 0). For instance the second edition
is obtained with:

```
http://neuma.huma-num.fr/rest/collections/22468/_sources/iiif/_editions/1
```

### Adding an edition

Adding an edition is a POST sent to the source URL. The message body
is the JSON representation of the edition. The new edition is appended 
to the list of editions of the source.

### Updating an edition

An edition can be updated by sending a POST request to its index in
the list of editions. For instance:

```
http://neuma.huma-num.fr/rest/collections/22468/_sources/iiif/_editions/1
```

### Clearing editions

Editions can be cleared with a DELETE request:

```
curl -u login:password -X DELETE
http://neuma.huma-num.fr/rest/collections/22468/_sources/iiif/_editions
```

## List of editions


### Describe parts

Defines metadata qualifying a part.
See the first example of this document.

### Assign staff to part

Tells that a staff is allocated to a part in a given range. The
parameters are

  - The part id
  - A staff number
  - A range

Example: the edition specified below tells that staff ``Staff1``
is allocated to part ``P1``, from the second system of page 3.

```json
{
	"name": "assign_staff_to_part",
	"params": {
		"part": "Part1",
		"staff_number": 1
		},
	"range": {
	    "from_page: 3,
	     "from_system: 2
         }
}
```


###  Merging parts

Two distinct parts can be *merged* (typically, staves interpreted as dictinct
parts, that actually correspond to a piano part). The parameter
is an array of part's ids. 

Example: the edition specified below merges parts ``p1``  and
``p2`` in ``p1``. 

```json
{
	"name": "merge_parts",
	"params": {
		"parts": ["p1", "p2"]
		}
}
```
